                    <h2 class="post-subtitle"> Section 1.4 Visualizing convolutional neural networks </h2>
                    <p>Numbers that were clearly written were classified correctly. 
                        The network misclassified the input when I exaggerated a part of the number 
                        or when the size of the number was too small. 
                        The network also failed to classify correctly when the number is placed in one of the corners.
                        However, the network performed unexpectedly well when the number was incomplete. 
                        For example, when only half of 3 was written out, the network still classified it as 3.  
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="post-subtitle"> Section 3.5 Fast Style Transfer</h2>
                    <p>Q1. What happens when you pass an image through the same filter several times? Do you observe any interesting characteristics or padding artifacts?</p>
                    <p>The change in style was the largest on the first pass. Then each pass introduced slight changes to the image, but they tend to be very subtle.</p>
                    
                    <p>Q2. Apply a filter to an image and then apply another filter to that already-filtered image. Is the result similar to what you would get when you apply the second filter to the original image?</p>
                    <p> 
                        Applying two different filters and applying only the second filter produce different results. 
                        The final outputs were similar in color, but the details were different. 
                        When an image was filtered with two styles, the final result contained the styles of the both filters. 
                        However, when some features of the original image were neglected or exaggerated after one filter, 
                        applying the second style filter couldn't bring the lost or modified features back. 
                        The second style filter ultimately decided the color scheme of the image.
                    </p>

                    <p>Q3. Try different combinations of filters and number of times you filter an image. 
                        Note on your website if you have any interesting observations or insights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As observed before, the final style filter significantly influenced the outcome of the image. 
                        Although multiple filters were applied in sequence, the final style was most visible. 
                    </p>
