                    <h2 class="post-subtitle"> Section 1.1 Visualizing datasets using the embedding projector </h2>
                    <p>
                        For Both PCA and t-SNE, different digits werew separated into different clouds. 
                        The distinction was clearly shown through the color coded clouds. 
                        In general, the separation of clouds were clearer for certain digits, including 1 and 7. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There were definitely images that were in wrong clounds. 
                        For example, 7 was found in the cloud 2. 
                        However, overall, most of the misclassifications were understandable, as for example, 2 resembles 7. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There were a lot of outliers, especially for PCA.
                        This can be attributed to the fact that PCA uses the three directions with large variance. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="post-subtitle"> Section 1.3 Word geometry</h2>
                    <p>The words appear closer if they are found in same phrases frequently. 
                        Therefore, results from a larger dataset doesn't necessarily match with the results from the smaller dataset. 
                        Word2Vec All produced different result from 10K dataset, not better results. </p>
                    <p>It was interesting to note that, neutral words, such as piano or a name of an object, 
                        didn't shift in horizontal direction as the size of the data set got larger. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="post-subtitle"> Section 1.4 Finding word analogies with vector algebra</h2>
                    <p>
                        App responded well to some typical examples such as "NIGHT is to DARK as MORNING is BRIGHT."
                        In some cases, the app seems to understand the logic begin the first analogy, but doesn't have enough information.
                        For example, PEN is to INK as PENCIL is to CARBON. While carbon can be a correct answer, since lead is in fact carbon, more informed answer would be PENCIL is to LEAD.
                        When the relationship between the two words in the first part of the analogy is ambiguous, the app simply spit out a similiar word.
                    </p>
